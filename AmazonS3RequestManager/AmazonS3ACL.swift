A list of predefined, or canned, ACLs recognized by the Amazon S3 service.

- Private:                Owner gets full control. No one else has access rights. This is the default ACL for a new bucket/object. Applies to buckets and objects.

- Public:                 Owner gets full control. All other users (anonymous or authenticated) get READ and WRITE access. Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended. Applies to buckets and objects.

- PublicReadOnly:         Owner gets full control. All other users (anonymous or authenticated) get READ access. Applies to buckets and objects.

- AuthenticatedReadOnly:  Owner gets full control. All authenticated users get READ access. Applies to buckets and objects.

- BucketOwnerReadOnly:    Object owner gets full control. Bucket owner gets READ access. Applies to objects only; if you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.

- BucketOwnerFullControl: Both the object owner and the bucket owner get full control over the object. Applies to objects only; if you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.

- LogDeliveryWrite:       The `LogDelivery` group gets WRITE and READ_ACP permissions on the bucket.

/**
MARK: - ACL Grantees

Defines a grantee to assign to a permission.

A grantee can be an AWS account or one of the predefined Amazon S3 groups. You grant permission to an AWS account by the email address or the canonical user ID.

:note: If you provide an email in your grant request, Amazon S3 finds the canonical user ID for that account and adds it to the ACL. The resulting ACLs will always contain the canonical user ID for the AWS account, not the AWS account's email address.

:see: For more information on Amazon S3 Service grantees, see "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#specifying-grantee"

- AuthenticatedUsers: This group represents all AWS accounts. Access permission to this group allows any AWS account to access the resource. However, all requests must be signed (authenticated).

- AllUsers:           Access permission to this group allows anyone to access the resource. The requests can be signed (authenticated) or unsigned (anonymous). Unsigned requests omit the Authentication header in the request.

- LogDeliveryGroup:   WRITE permission on a bucket enables this group to write server access logs to the bucket.
  :see: For more information on the log delivery group, see "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html"

- EmailAddress:       A grantee for the AWS account with the given email address.

- UserID:             A grantee for the AWS account with the given canonical user ID.
